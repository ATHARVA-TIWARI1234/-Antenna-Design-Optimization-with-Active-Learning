Project on AI enabled antenna design


This project focuses on the design and optimization of a various antenna designs using machine learning techniques. We mainly worked on two type of designs: polygons and pixelated. The initial design utilized a 6x6 pixel grid with each pixel containing 36 rectangular patches, which was iteratively refined to improve performance and reduce metal content. The final design comprised 18 rectangular patches per pixel on one half of the board, mirrored on the other half, achieving a 73% resonance rate across 2800 samples. The dataset generated included features and S11 values for each design, which were used to train various deep learning models. For polygon datset we used feedforward neural networks and 1D CNNs since no of features were low and these gave good enough results with less dataset. For pixelated design for each input we had 36*6=216 features and for it we used specialized 2D CNN. We had a dataset of 5000 for polygon designs , but for pixelated design since it took a lot of time to simulate we only had dataset of 2800. Despite the complex data and limited dataset size, the 2D CNN achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 2.26. With polygon design we were able to get lowest MSE as 1.91. Active learning techniques such as Bayesian optimization and Query By Committee were applied to further improve model performance with fewer labeled instances. This approach demonstrates significant advancements in antenna design, potentially transforming how such designs are approached in the industry. For polygon dataset Bayesian active learning with Disagreement worked best since with only 1400 samples we were able to reach accuracy which we got by training odel on 2800 samples. For pixelated antenna design Bayesian optimization with lower confidence bound as aquistition function showed similar results.
